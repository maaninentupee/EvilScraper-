# Extended Analysis of Ollama Resources

## Overview

This document describes the use and interpretation of the extended Ollama resource analysis tool. The extended analysis provides a deeper insight into the resource usage of Ollama models at different load levels and with different models.

## Features of the Extended Analysis

The extended analysis tool (`analyze-ollama-resources-extended.sh`) includes the following features:

1. **System Information Collection**:
   - CPU information (model, number of cores)
   - Memory information (physical memory, swap)
   - Operating system information

2. **Testing All Available Models**:
   - Automatically tests all models available in the Ollama service
   - Collects information about each model separately

3. **Testing Different Concurrency Levels**:
   - Tests each model with 1, 2, and 5 concurrent requests
   - Analyzes resource usage at different load levels

4. **More Comprehensive Resource Monitoring**:
   - CPU usage by process and by core
   - Memory usage and memory maps
   - Network activity
   - Disk activity

5. **Detailed Reporting**:
   - Summary report in Markdown format
   - Tables of CPU and memory usage by model and concurrency level
   - Response time analysis

## Usage

Using the extended analysis tool:

```bash
# Make sure the Ollama service is running
# Make sure the Windsurf server is running (npm run dev)

# Run the extended analysis
./scripts/analyze-ollama-resources-extended.sh
```

Running the analysis takes significantly longer than the basic analysis because it tests each model at several different concurrency levels.

## Interpreting Results

The extended analysis produces a comprehensive report in the `ollama-resource-analysis-extended-[timestamp]` directory. The main report is `extended_summary.md`, which includes:

### 1. CPU Usage Analysis

The CPU usage table shows the minimum, maximum, and average CPU usage for each model and concurrency level. This helps identify:

- Which models use the most CPU resources
- How CPU usage scales with increasing concurrency
- Potential bottlenecks at high concurrency levels

### 2. Memory Usage Analysis

The memory usage table shows the minimum, maximum, and average memory usage for each model and concurrency level. This helps identify:

- Which models use the most memory
- How memory usage scales with increasing concurrency
- Potential memory leaks in long-term use

### 3. Response Time Analysis

The response time table shows the average response time for each model and concurrency level. This helps:

- Compare the performance of different models
- Evaluate the impact of concurrency on response times
- Identify the optimal concurrency level for each model

## Recommended Use Cases

The extended analysis is particularly useful in the following situations:

1. **Model Selection**: When you want to select the optimal model for a specific use case based on performance and resource usage.

2. **Capacity Planning**: When planning server resources for a production environment and you want to know how many resources you need with a certain number of users.

3. **Performance Optimization**: When you want to optimize the Ollama configuration (batch-size, ctx-size, threads) based on actual performance measurements.

4. **Concurrency Optimization**: When you want to determine the optimal concurrency level that balances performance and resource usage.

## Limitations

The extended analysis is comprehensive, but it has certain limitations:

1. The analysis can take a long time, especially if multiple models are in use.
2. High concurrency levels can cause system overload.
3. The analysis does not take into account the effects of long-term use (e.g., memory leaks over a long period).
4. Results may vary depending on other system load.

## Future Development Ideas

Future development ideas for the extended analysis:

1. Graphical visualization of CPU and memory usage over time
2. Automatic optimization of configuration parameters based on results
3. Support for long-term tests (hours or days)
4. Comparison between different Ollama versions
5. Temperature monitoring in long-term tests
