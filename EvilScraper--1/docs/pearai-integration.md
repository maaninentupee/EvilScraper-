# AI-Based Code Optimization

This document describes how AI-based code optimization works as part of the code development and optimization workflow.

## AI Models in Optimization

The workflow utilizes two powerful AI models for code optimization:

1. **Anthropic Claude**: Used as the primary optimization model for fixing SonarQube findings
2. **OpenAI GPT-4**: Used as a secondary model for making additional optimizations

This two-model approach provides more comprehensive optimization, as the models complement each other with their different strengths.

## Integration with SonarQube

AI optimization is integrated with SonarQube:

1. SonarQube identifies code issues and vulnerabilities
2. Anthropic Claude focuses on fixing the issues detected by SonarQube
3. OpenAI GPT-4 makes additional optimizations and refactorings
4. This targeted approach ensures that optimizations are relevant and effective

## AI API Integration in GitHub Actions Workflow

In the GitHub Actions workflow, AI integration works as follows:

```yaml
- name: ü§ñ Send code issues to Anthropic Claude for optimization
  run: |
    curl -X POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/complete" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "model": "claude-3-opus-2024-02-22",
      "prompt": "Optimize the following code based on SonarQube report:\n" + cat sonar-report.json,
      "max_tokens": 500
    }' > anthropic-optimized.json

- name: ü§ñ Send code issues to OpenAI GPT-4 for additional optimizations
  run: |
    curl -X POST "https://api.openai.com/v1/completions" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "model": "gpt-4-turbo",
      "prompt": "Refactor and improve performance of the following code:\n" + cat anthropic-optimized.json,
      "max_tokens": 500
    }' > openai-optimized.json
```

This process:
1. Sends the SonarQube report to Anthropic Claude for optimization
2. Sends Claude's optimized code to OpenAI GPT-4 for additional optimizations
3. Combines the optimizations from both models for the final result

## SonarQube Report Structure

SonarQube API returns a JSON-formatted report that contains all detected issues:

```json
{
  "total": 3,
  "issues": [
    {
      "key": "AYxyz123456",
      "component": "maaninentupee_EvilScraper:src/utils.ts",
      "line": 15,
      "message": "Remove this unused import of 'useMemo'",
      "severity": "MINOR",
      "type": "CODE_SMELL"
    },
    {
      "key": "AYxyz789012",
      "component": "maaninentupee_EvilScraper:src/api.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "message": "Add type annotations to this function's parameters",
      "severity": "MAJOR",
      "type": "CODE_SMELL"
    }
  ]
}
```

## AI Optimization Results

AI models produce optimized code that includes fixes for issues detected by SonarQube. The optimized code is saved to a JSON file that contains:

1. Fixed code snippets
2. Explanations of the changes made
3. Recommendations for further actions

## Combining Optimizations

In the GitHub Actions workflow, optimizations from both AI models are combined:

```yaml
- name: üîÑ Merge Optimized Code
  run: |
    jq -s '.[0] * .[1]' anthropic-optimized.json openai-optimized.json > final-optimized.json
```

This command uses the `jq` tool to combine the JSON results from both models into a single optimized result.

## Applying Fixes

In the GitHub Actions workflow, the AI-optimized code is applied automatically:

```yaml
- name: üîÑ Commit Optimized Code
  run: |
    git config --global user.name "github-actions"
    git config --global user.email "actions@github.com"
    git checkout -b ai-optimized
    cp optimized-code.json .
    git add .
    git commit -m "‚ôªÔ∏è AI Optimized Code (Anthropic Claude & OpenAI GPT-4)"
    git push origin ai-optimized
```

This script:
1. Creates a new branch called "ai-optimized"
2. Copies the optimized code to the project directory
3. Commits and pushes the changes to the new branch

## Pull Request Process

After the fixes, GitHub Actions automatically creates a pull request:

```yaml
- name: üîÄ Create Pull Request for Optimized Code
  uses: repo-sync/pull-request@v2
  with:
    source_branch: "ai-optimized"
    destination_branch: "main"
    pr_title: "‚ôªÔ∏è AI Optimized Code (Claude & GPT-4)"
    pr_body: "This PR contains AI-optimized fixes based on SonarQube analysis using Anthropic Claude and OpenAI GPT-4."
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Mac Mini Environment

The GitHub Actions workflow is optimized for the Mac Mini environment:

```yaml
jobs:
  analyze-and-optimize:
    runs-on: macos-latest  # Uses macOS environment
```

This enables efficient performance and compatibility with macOS-specific tools.

## Best Practices

1. **Always review AI optimizations** before accepting them
2. **Test the changes** to ensure they don't break functionality
3. **Update API keys** regularly to ensure security
4. **Make sure GitHub secrets are configured** (SONAR_TOKEN, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, and OPENAI_API_KEY)
5. **Utilize the Mac Mini environment** for testing macOS-specific features
