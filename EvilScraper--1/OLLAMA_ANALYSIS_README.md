# Ollama Resource Analysis - Summary

This document compiles all tools and documents related to Ollama resource analysis in the Windsurf project.

## Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of Ollama resource analysis is to:

1. Understand the resource usage of Ollama models in different situations
2. Identify potential bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
3. Help select appropriate models and configurations for different use cases
4. Support planning for system scalability

## Available Tools

### 1. Basic Analysis

**Script**: [scripts/analyze-ollama-resources.sh](scripts/analyze-ollama-resources.sh)

This script performs a basic analysis of Ollama resource usage. It collects information about CPU and memory usage and performs a simple load test.

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/analyze-ollama-resources.sh
```

**Results**: Results are saved to the `ollama-resource-analysis-[timestamp]` directory.

**Documentation**: [OLLAMA_RESOURCE_ANALYSIS.md](OLLAMA_RESOURCE_ANALYSIS.md)

### 2. Extended Analysis

**Script**: [scripts/analyze-ollama-resources-extended.sh](scripts/analyze-ollama-resources-extended.sh)

This script performs a more comprehensive analysis that tests all available models at different concurrency levels. It collects more detailed information about resource usage and produces a comprehensive summary report.

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/analyze-ollama-resources-extended.sh
```

**Results**: Results are saved to the `ollama-resource-analysis-extended-[timestamp]` directory.

**Documentation**: [OLLAMA_EXTENDED_ANALYSIS.md](OLLAMA_EXTENDED_ANALYSIS.md)

## Analysis Results

### Basic Analysis Results

The basic analysis showed that:

1. **CPU Usage**:
   - The Ollama service uses significant CPU resources especially during startup
   - During load, CPU usage increases but remains at a reasonable level
   - The system quickly returns to normal state after load

2. **Memory Usage**:
   - The Ollama runner process uses significant memory (~560-580 MB)
   - Memory usage remains fairly stable during load
   - Swap memory is used considerably, which may affect performance

### Extended Analysis Results

The extended analysis provides a deeper insight:

1. **Model Comparison**:
   - Resource usage and performance of different models
   - Optimal model for different use cases

2. **Impact of Concurrency**:
   - How resource usage scales with increasing concurrency
   - Optimal concurrency level for different models

3. **System Limitations**:
   - When the system begins to overload
   - How many concurrent requests the system can handle

## Recommendations

Based on the analyses, we recommend:

1. **Model Selection**:
   - Use smaller models (7B) for general tasks
   - Use larger models (13B+) only for demanding tasks

2. **Configuration Optimization**:
   - Adjust the `--threads` parameter to match the number of available CPU cores
   - Optimize `--batch-size` and `--ctx-size` parameters according to the use case

3. **System Resources**:
   - Ensure sufficient physical memory (at least 16 GB)
   - Minimize swap memory usage to improve performance

4. **Scalability**:
   - Consider using multiple Ollama instances to distribute the load
   - Implement automatic scaling according to load

## Next Steps

1. Regular monitoring of resource usage in the production environment
2. Testing new models and Ollama versions
3. Continuous optimization of configuration parameters
4. Automatic monitoring and alerts when resource usage exceeds thresholds
